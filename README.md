## ðŸ“œ Ciphers Included

| Cipher | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Affine Cipher** | A type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher using mathematical functions. |
| **Atbash Cipher** | A simple substitution cipher where letters are reversed (A â†” Z, B â†” Y, etc.). |
| **Autokey Cipher** | A polyalphabetic cipher that uses the plaintext to extend the key. |
| **Beaufort Cipher** | Similar to the VigenÃ¨re cipher but with a different encryption algorithm. |
| **Caesar Cipher** | One of the oldest and simplest ciphers, using a fixed shift. |
| **Columnar Cipher** | A transposition cipher that writes plaintext into columns based on a keyword. |
| **Double Transpositional Cipher** | Encrypts the plaintext by performing two successive transpositions. |
| **Gronsfeld Cipher** | A variation of the VigenÃ¨re cipher using digits as the key. |
| **Hill Cipher** | A polygraphic cipher based on linear algebra and matrix multiplication. |
| **Myszkowski Cipher** | A transposition cipher that handles repeated keyword characters uniquely. |
| **Rail Fence Cipher** | A form of transposition cipher that arranges text in a zigzag pattern. |
| **Route Cipher** | Encrypts text by placing it in a grid and reading in a specific pattern. |
| **Running Key Cipher** | Uses a long passage of text as the key, typically from a book. |
| **VigenÃ¨re Cipher** | A famous polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters. |
